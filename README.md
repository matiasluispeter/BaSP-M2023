I develop the html project. First i develop the head and body. Into the head i put the title and in the body the aside, header and footer. Into the body there are differents sections as in the figma project. During this development i was in contact with my partners and we did some meets to resolve the problems. Besides, i did my git hub account and i learn how to do commits and push. On the other hand, i did a new file into my desktop.
